FOREWORD
</h2>

<p class="first">
The following chapters are primarily an
attempt at showing the position of the
Quakers in the family to which they belong&mdash;the
family of the mystics.
</p>

<p>
In the second place comes a consideration
of the method of worship and of corporate
living laid down by the founder of Quakerism,
as best calculated to foster mystical
gifts and to strengthen in the community
as a whole that sense of the Divine, indwelling
and accessible, to which some few of his
followers had already attained, and of
which all those he had gathered round him
had a dawning apprehension.
</p>

<p>
The famous &ldquo;peculiarities&rdquo; of the Quakers
fall into place as following inevitably from
their central belief.
</p>

<p>
The ebb and flow of that belief, as it is
<a id="page-VI" class="pagenum" title="VI"></a>
found embodied in the history of the Society
of Friends, has been dealt with as fully as
space has allowed.
</p>

<p>
My thanks are due to Mr. Norman Penney,
F.S.A., F.R.Hist.S., Librarian of the Friends&rsquo;
Reference Library, for a helpful revision of
my manuscript.

</h2>

<p class="first">
The Quakers appeared about a hundred
years after the decentralization of authority
in theological science. The Reformers&rsquo;
dream of a remade church had ended in
a Europe where, over against an alienated
parent, four young Protestant communions
disputed together as to the doctrinal interpretation
of the scriptures. Within
these communions the goal towards which
the breaking away from the Roman centre
had been an unconscious step was already
well in view. It was obvious that the
separated churches were helpless against
the demands arising in their midst for the
right of individual interpretation where
they themselves drew such widely differing
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
conclusions. The Bible, abroad amongst
the people for the first time, helped on the
loosening of the hold of stereotyped beliefs.
Independent groups appeared in every
direction.
</p>

<p>
In England, the first movement towards
the goal of &ldquo;religious liberty&rdquo; was made
by a body of believers who declared that a
national church was against the will of
God. Catholic in ideal, democratic in form,
they set their hope upon a world-wide
Christendom of self-governing congregations.
They increased with great rapidity,
suffered persecution, martyrdom, and temporary
dispersal.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Following on this first challenge came the
earliest stirring of a more conservative
catholicism. Fed by such minds as that of
Nicholas Farrer, grieving in scholarly seclusion
over the ravages of the Protestantisms,
it found expression in Laud&rsquo;s effort to restore
the broken continuity of tradition in
the English church, to reintroduce beauty
into her services, and, while preserving her
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
identity as a developing national body, to
keep open a rearward window to the light
of accumulated experience and teaching.
But hardly-won freedom saw popery in
his every act, and his final absolutism, his
demand for executive power independent of
Parliament, wrecked the effort and cost
him his life.
</p>

<p>
These characteristic neo-Protestantisms
were obscured at the moment of the appearance
of the Quakers by the opening in this
country of the full blossom of the Genevan
theology. The fate of the Presbyterian
system, which covered England like a network,
and had threatened during the shifting
policies of Charles&rsquo;s long struggle for absolute
monarchy to become the established
church of England, was sealed, it is true,
when Cromwell&rsquo;s Independent army checked
the proceedings of a Presbyterian House of
Commons; but the Calvinian reading of the
scriptures had prevailed over the popular
imagination, and in the Protectorate Church
where Baptists, Independents, and Presbyterians
held livings side by side with the
clergy of the Protestant Establishment,
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
where the use of the Prayer-Book was forbidden
and the scriptures were at last
supreme, the predominant type of religious
culture was what we have since learned to
call Puritanism. In 1648 Puritanism had
reached its great moment. Its poet<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> was
growing to manhood, tortured by the uncertainty
of election, half-maddened by his
vision of the doom hanging over a sin-stained
world.
</p>

<p>
But far away beneath the institutional
confusions and doctrinal dilemmas of this
post-Reformation century fresh life was
welling up. The unsatisfied religious energy
of the maturing Germanic peoples, groping
its own way home, had produced Boehme
and his followers, and filled the by-ways of
Europe with mystical sects. Outwards from
free Holland&mdash;whose republic on a basis of
religious toleration had been founded in
1579&mdash;spread the Anabaptists, Mennonites,
and others. Coming to England, they reinforced
the native groups&mdash;the Baptists,
Familists, and Seekers&mdash;who were preaching
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
personal religion up and down the country
under the protection of Cromwell&rsquo;s indulgence
for &ldquo;tender&rdquo; consciences, and found
their characteristically English epitome and
spokesman in George Fox.
</p>

<p>
Born in an English village<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a> of homely
pious parents,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a> who were both in sympathy
with their thoughtful boy, his genius developed
harmoniously and early.
</p>

<p>
Until his twentieth year he worked with
a shoemaker, who was also a dealer in cattle
and wool, and proved his capacity for business
life. Then a crisis came, brought about
by an incident meeting him as he went
about his master&rsquo;s affairs. He had been
sent on business to a fair, and had come
upon two friends, one of them a relative,
who tried to draw him into a bout of health-drinking.
George, who had had his one
glass, laid down a groat and went home in
a state of great disturbance, for he knew
both these men to be professors of religion.
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
He grappled with the difficulty at once.
He spent the hours of that night in pacing
up and down his room, in prayer and crying
out, in sitting still and reflecting. In the
light of the afternoon&rsquo;s incidents he saw and
felt for the first time the average daily life
of the world about him, &ldquo;how young
people go together into vanity, and old people
into the earth,&rdquo; all that gave meaning to
life for him had no existence in their lives,
even in the lives of professing Christians.
He was thrown in on himself. If God was
not with those who professed him, where
was He?
</p>

<p>
The labours and gropings of the night
simplified before the dawn came to the
single conviction that he must &ldquo;forsake all,
both young and old, and keep out of all,
and be a stranger unto all.&rdquo; There was no
hesitating. He went forth at once and
wandered for four years up and down the
Midland counties seeking for light, for
truth, for firm ground in the quicksands of
disintegrating faiths, for a common principle
where men seemed to pull every way
at once. He sought all the &ldquo;professors&rdquo;
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
of every shade and listened to all, but would
associate with none, shunning those who
sought him out: &ldquo;I was afraid of them, for
I was sensible they did not possess what
they professed.&rdquo; He went to hear the
great preachers of the day in London and
elsewhere, but found no light in them. Now
and again amongst obscure groups to which
hope drew him one and another were struck
by his sayings, and responded to him, but
he shrank from their approval. The clergy
of different denominations in the neighbourhood
of his home, where he returned
for a while in response to the disquietude
of his parents, could not understand his
difficulties. How should they? He was
perfectly sound in every detail of the
Calvinian doctrine. They could make
nothing of a distress so unlike that of
other pious young Puritans. Orthodox as
he was, there is no sign in his outpourings
of any concern for his soul, not a word of
fear, nor any sense of sin, though he heartily
acknowledges temptations, a divided nature,
&ldquo;two thirsts.&rdquo; He begs the priests to tell
him the meaning of his troubled state&mdash;not
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
as one doubting, but rather with the
restiveness of one under a bondage, keeping
him from that which he knows to be
accessible.
</p>

<p>
One minister advised tobacco and psalm-singing,
another physic and bleeding. His
family urged him to marry.
</p>

<p>
His distress grew, amounting sometimes
to acute agony of mind: &ldquo;As I cannot declare
the great misery I was in, it was so
great and heavy upon me, so neither can I
set forth the mercies of God unto me in all
my misery.&rdquo; Brief intermissions there were
when he was &ldquo;brought into such a joy that
I thought I had been in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But on the whole his wretchedness
steadily increased. None could help. The
written word had ceased to comfort him.
He wandered days and nights in solitary
places taking no food.
</p>

<p>
Illumination came at last&mdash;a series of
convictions dawning in the mind that truth
cannot be found in outward things, and,
finally, the moment of release&mdash;the sense of
which he tries to convey to us under the
symbolism of a voice making his heart leap
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
for joy&mdash;leaving him remade in a new
world.
</p>

<p>
Two striking passages from his Journal
may serve to illustrate this period of his
experience: &ldquo;The Lord did gently lead me
along, and did let me see His love, which
was endless and eternal, and surpasseth all
the knowledge that men have in the natural
state, or can get by history or books ...
and I was afraid of all company, for I saw
them perfectly where they were, through
the love of God which let me see myself&rdquo;;
and, again, as he struggles to express the
change that had taken place for him: &ldquo;Now
I was come up in spirit through the flaming
sword into the paradise of God. All things
were new; and all the creation gave another
smell unto me than before beyond what
words can utter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two years of intense life followed. He
came back to the world with his message for
all men, all churches, with no new creed to
preach, but to call all men to see their
creeds in the light of the living experience
which had first produced them, to live themselves
in that light shining pure and
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
original within each one of them, the light
which wrote the scriptures and founded the
churches; to refuse to be put off any longer
with &ldquo;notions,&rdquo; mere doctrines, derivative
testimonies obscuring the immediate
communication of life to the man himself.
</p>

<p>
This message&mdash;the message of the inner
light of immediate inspiration, of the
existence in every man of some measure
of the Spirit of God&mdash;the Quakers laid, as
it were, side by side with the doctrines of
the Puritanism amidst which they were
born. They did not escape the absolute
dualism of the thought of their day. They
believed man to be shut up in sin, altogether
evil, and they declared at the same
time that there is in every man that which
will, if he yields to its guidance, lift him
above sin, is able to make him here and now
free and sinless. The essential irreconcilability
of the two positions does not
appear to have troubled them.
</p>

<p>
This belief in the divine light within the
individual soul was, of course, nothing
new. The Roman Church had taught it.
Instruction as to the conditions whereby it
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
may have its way with a man was the end
of her less worldly labours.
</p>

<p>
The Protestants taught it; the acceptance
of salvation, the birth of the light in the darkness
of the individual soul was the message
of the Book. But George Fox and his
followers claimed that the measure of
divine life, nesting, as it were, within the
life of each man, was universal, was before
churches and scriptures, and had always led
mankind. Yet it was not to be confused
with the natural light of reason of the
Socinians and Deists, for the first step
towards union with it was a control of all
creaturely activities, a total abandonment
of each and every claim of the surface intelligence&mdash;&ldquo;notions,&rdquo;
as the Quakers called
them&mdash;a process of retirement into the
innermost region of being, into &ldquo;the light,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the seed,&rdquo; &ldquo;the ground of the soul,&rdquo;
&ldquo;that which hath convinced you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The God of the Quakers, then, was no
literary obsession coming to meet them
along the pages of history; no traditional
immensity visiting man once, and silent
ever since, to be momentarily invoked from
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
infinite spatial distance by external means
of grace; no &ldquo;notion,&rdquo; no mere metaphysical
absolute, but a living process, a
changing, changeless absolute, a breath
controlling all things, an amazing birth
within the soul. Tradition they valued as
a record of God&rsquo;s dealings with man. The
Bible held for them no enfeebling spell.
Their controversial writings have, indeed,
anticipated, as has recently been pointed
out,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-5" id="fnote-5">[5]</a> the methods of the higher criticism;
they touch on the synoptic problems; they
ask their biblicist opponents whether they
are talking of original autographs, transcribed
copies, or translations. They rally
them: &ldquo;Who was it that said to the Spirit
of God, O Spirit, blow no more, inspire
no more men, make no more prophets from
Ezra&rsquo;s days downward till Christ, and from
John&rsquo;s days downward for ever? But
cease, be silent, and subject thyself, as
well as all evil spirits, to be tried by the
standard that&rsquo;s made up of some of the
writings of some of those men thou hast
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
moved to write already; and let such and
such of them as are bound up in the bibles
now used in England be the only means of
measuring all truth for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Incarnation was to them the one instance
of a perfect shining of the light, a
perfect realization of the fusion of human
and divine, the full indwelling of the Godhead,
which was their goal. The incidents
of that life shone clear to them in the light
of what went forward in themselves in proportion
as they struggled to live in the spirit.
</p>

<p>
But neither was this claim, the assertion
of an immediate pathway to reality within
the man himself, anything new in the world.
Each nation, each great period of civilization,
has produced individuals, or groups separated
by time and creed, but unanimous in
their testimony as to its existence.
</p>

<p>
The giants among them stand upon the
highest peaks of human civilization. Their
art or method in debased or arrested forms
is to be found in every valley. They have
been called &ldquo;mystics,&rdquo; and it is to the
classical century of European mysticism, to
the group (of which Tauler was the mainstay)
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
calling themselves the &ldquo;Friends of
God,&rdquo; that we must go for an outbreak of
mystical genius akin to that which took
place in seventeenth-century England. Both
groups made war on the official Christianity
of their day, and strove to relate Christendom
afresh to its true source of vitality, to
re-form the church on a spiritual basis. The
testimony, the end, and the means for the
attainment of the end were the same in
both. The immense distinction between
them arose from the difference in the conditions
under which the two ventures were
made. The fourteenth-century mystics
opened their eyes in a congenial environment,
in a church whose symbolism, teaching,
and ordinances, were a coherent reflection
of their own experiences, stood
justified by their personal knowledge of
the &ldquo;law&rdquo; of spiritual development, the
conditions of advance in the way on which
their feet were set.
</p>

<p>
They owed much to tradition, to their
theological studies, to their familiarity with
the recorded experiences of holy men;
they recognized their church as the transmitter
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
of this tradition, as the guardian of
saintly testimony on the subject of their
art. They recognized her, not as an end
but as a means, not as a prison, but as a
home for all the human family, keeping
open her doors, on the one hand, to the unconverted,
providing, on the other, a suitable
medium, the right atmosphere and
opportunities, whereby pilgrims in the spiritual
life might develop, to their full, possibilities
in advance of the common measure
of the group. They chid her, they exposed
abuses, and called for reforms; they challenged
the &ldquo;carnal conception&rdquo; of the
sacraments, and denounced the loose lives of
her dignitaries; but they remained in the
church.
</p>

<p>
The Quakers, on the contrary, appeared
when few of those who were in authority
were able to understand what had arisen
in their midst. Fox brought his challenge
by the wayside; untrammelled by tradition,
fearless in inexperience, he endowed all
men with his own genius, and called upon
the whole world to join him in the venture
of faith.

</h3>

<p class="first">
When Fox came back to the world from his
lonely wanderings, he had no thought of
setting up a church in opposition to, or
in any sort of competition with, existing
churches. His message was for all, worshipping
under whatever name or form; his
sole concern to reveal to men their own
wealth, to wean them to turn from words
and ceremonials, from all merely outward
things, to seek first the inner reality.
Many of the Puritan leaders were brought
by their contact with Fox to a more vital
attitude with regard to the faith in which
they had been brought up. Several of
the magistrates before whom he and his
followers were continually being haled, unable
after hours of examination and discussion
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
not only to find any cause of offence
in these men, but unable, also, to resist
the appeal of their strength and sincerity,
espoused their cause with every degree of
warmth, from whole-hearted adherence to
lifelong, unflagging interest and sympathy.
But the general attitude, from the panic-stricken
behaviour of those who regarded
the Quakers as black magicians, incarnations
of the Evil One, or Jesuits in disguise, to
the grave concern of the Calvinist divines,
who saw in the Quaker movement a profane
attack upon the foundation-rock of
Holy Scripture, was one of fear&mdash;fear
based, as is usual, upon misunderstanding.
A concise reasoned formulation of the
Quaker standpoint, though it may be picked
out from the writings of Fox and the early
apologists, was to come, and then only imperfectly,
when the scholarly Robert Barclay
joined the group; meanwhile, the
sometimes rather amorphous enthusiasm,
the &ldquo;mysterious meetings,&rdquo; the apocalyptic
claims and denunciations&mdash;meaningless
to those who had no key&mdash;stood as a
barrier between the &ldquo;children of the light&rdquo;
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
and the religious fellowship of the Commonwealth
church. Fear is clearly visible at
the root of the instant and savage persecution
of the Quakers, not only by the mob,
but by official Calvinism, throughout the
chapter of its power. The keynote was
struck by the local authorities at Nottingham,
who responded to Fox&rsquo;s plea for the
Inner Light during a Sunday morning&rsquo;s
service in the parish church by putting him
in prison. It is usually maintained that his
offence was brawling, but it is difficult to
reconcile this reading with the facts of the
case. Theological disputations were the
most popular diversions of the day. There
were no newspapers, nor, in the modern
sense of the word, either &ldquo;politics&rdquo; or
books; popular literature consisted largely
of religious pamphlets; amateur theologians
abounded; the public meetings arousing the
maximum of enthusiasm were those gathered
for the duels of well-known controversialists;
while speaking in church after the
minister had finished was not only recognized,
but far from unusual. In this instance
the minister had preached from the
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
text, &ldquo;We have also a more sure word of
prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye
take heed, as unto a light that shineth in
a dark place, until the day dawn and the
day star arise in your hearts,&rdquo; and had developed
his theme in the sense that the sure
word of prophecy was the record of the
Scripture. Fox&mdash;whom we may imagine
already much the man William Penn
later on described for us as &ldquo;no busybody
or self-seeker, neither touchy nor
critical ... so meek, contented, modest,
easy, steady, tender, it was a pleasure to
be in his company.... I never saw him
out of his place or not a match for every
service and occasion; for in all things he
acquitted himself like a man&mdash;yea, a strong
man, a new and heavenly-minded man&mdash;civil
beyond all forms of breeding in his
behaviour&rdquo;&mdash;rose with his challenge, threw
down the gauntlet to biblicism, and declared
that the Light was not the Scriptures,
but the Spirit of God....
</p>

<p>
But, as we have seen, religious England
was not wholly Puritan. Fox&rsquo;s world was
waiting for him. From every denomination
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
and every rank of society the Children of
the Light came forth. Very many&mdash;notably
the nuclear members of small independent
groups&mdash;had reached the Quaker experience
before he came. The beliefs and customs
which have since been identified with the
Society of Friends were already in existence
in the group of Separated Baptists at Mansfield
in Nottingham, which formed in face
of the closed doors of official religion the
centre of the little Quaker church. The
singleness of type, moreover, in the missionary
work of the early Quakers, extending,
as it did, over the whole of Christendom,
carried on independently by widely differing
natures&mdash;&ldquo;narrow&rdquo; nonconformist ministers,
prosperous business men, army officers
and privates, shepherds, cloth-makers,
gentlewomen and domestic servants, under
every variety of circumstance, would be
enough in itself to reveal Fox as the child
of his time. But as we watch the movement,
as we see it assailed by those dangers
arising wherever systems and doctrines are
left behind and reason gets to work upon
the facts of a man&rsquo;s own experience; as we
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
find the fresh life threatening here to
crystallize into formal idealism, there to
flow away into pantheism or antinomianism,
again to pour into a dead sea of placid
illumination; as we see the little church
surviving these dangers and continually reviving,
we recognize that Fox was more
than the liberator of mystical activity.
He was its steersman. His constructive
genius cast the mould which has enabled
this experiment to escape the fate overtaking
similar efforts. Seventeenth-century
mysticism in France<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-6" id="fnote-6">[6]</a> and Spain was succumbing
to Quietism. Molinos, the Spanish
monk, a contemporary of Fox, popularized
a debased form of Teresian mysticism,
formulating it as a state &ldquo;where the
soul loses itself in the soft and savoury
sleep of nothingness, and enjoys it knows
not what&rdquo;; while in France the practice
of passive contemplation had gained in
the religious life of the time a popularity
which even the mystical genius of Madame
Guyon&mdash;who herself, it is true, lays in her
writings over-much stress upon this, the
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
first step of the mystic way&mdash;failed to
disturb.
</p>

<p>
For Fox, we cannot keep too clearly in
mind, the relationship of the soul to the
Light was a life-process; the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; was
not in contradistinction to the outer. For
him, the great adventure, the abstraction
from all externality, the purging of the self,
the Godward energizing of the lonely soul,
was in the end, as it has been in all the great
&ldquo;actives&rdquo; among the mystics, the most
practical thing in the world, and ultimately
fruitful in life-ends. He surprises us by
the intensity of his objective vision, by the
number of modern movements he anticipates:
popular education; the abolition of
slavery; the substitution of arbitration for
warfare amongst nations, and for litigation
between individuals; prison reform, and the
revising of accepted notions as to the status
of women. He delights us with the strong
balance of his godliness, his instant suspicion
of religiosity and emotionalism, his
dealing with those extremes of physical
and mental disturbance which are apt in
unstable natures to accompany any sudden
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
flooding of the field of consciousness; his
discouragement of ranting and &ldquo;eloquence,&rdquo;
of self-assertion and infallibility&mdash;of anything
indicating lack of control, or militating
against the full operation of the
light.
</p>

<p>
But, enormously powerful as was the influence
of Fox upon the movement which
he liberated and steered, it was at the same
time exceptionally free&mdash;even in relation
to the comparatively imitative mass of the
Quaker church&mdash;from that limitation which
justifies the famous description of an institution
as the lengthened shadow of a
man. The partial escape of the Quaker
church from this almost universal fate of
institutions becomes clear when we fix our
attention on the essential nature of Fox&rsquo;s
&ldquo;discovery&rdquo; and what was involved in his
offering it to the laity, when we note that
within the Quaker borders there arose that
insistence on the &ldquo;originality&rdquo; of life on
all levels that has, at last, in our own day,
made its appearance in official philosophy.

II
</h3>

<p class="first">
The history of the Quaker experiment reveals
in England three main movements: the
first corresponding roughly to the life of Fox,
and covering the period of expansion, persecution,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-7" id="fnote-7">[7]</a>
and establishment; the second,
which may be called the retreat of Quakerism,
the quiet cultivation of Quaker method;
and the third, the modern evangelistic
revival.
</p>

<p>
The first rapid spreading in the North of
England was materially helped by the
establishment, in 1652, of a centre at
Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston in Lancashire,
the property of Judge Fell and his
wife Margaret, good churchpeople, much
given to religious exercises, and holding
open house for travelling ministers of all
denominations. The capture of this stronghold
gave the movement a northern headquarters,
and a post-office. Margaret Fell,
converted by Fox at the age of thirty-eight,
built the rest of her life into the movement;
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
seventeen years later&mdash;more than ten years
after the death of her husband&mdash;she became
Fox&rsquo;s wife. Her voluminous and
carefully preserved correspondence with the
leading missionaries of the group alone
forms almost a journal of the early years
of the Society.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-8" id="fnote-8">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
The whole of the countryside at Swarthmoor,
whose minister Fox had repudiated,
finding him filled with a ranting spirit,
high words and &ldquo;notions&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;full of filth,&rdquo;
as he tersely notes in his Journal&mdash;came out
against him.
</p>

<p>
He was given up to justice, ordered to be
whipped, and then handed over to the
mercy of the mob, who beat him until he
fell senseless. Presently, rising up, he bade
them strike again. A mason numbed his
arm with a blow from a staff; the arm recovered
instantly under the power of his
outgoing love for his persecutors. Incidents
of this kind&mdash;of beatings, stonings,
and assaults of a more disgusting nature&mdash;are
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
typical of the treatment received with
unvarying sweetness by the Quaker missionaries,
both in England and in America.
On several occasions Fox&rsquo;s life was attempted.
</p>

<p>
Persecutions of all kinds, moreover, fell
far more heavily upon the Quakers than
upon other nonconformists, owing to their
persistence in holding their meetings openly&mdash;meeting
in the street if their premises
were burned down, the children meeting
together when the parents were imprisoned.
Fines, flogging, pillory, the loathsomeness
of damp and uncleansed dungeons, the
brutality of gaolers, left their serenity unmoved;
the exposure of women in the stocks
for seventeen hours on a November night
confirmed their faith. In the Restoration
period particularly, when the strong influence
of the religious soldiers of the Commonwealth&mdash;many
of whom, including Cromwell,
were able to grasp the tendency of
Fox&rsquo;s conception&mdash;was removed, persecution
became methodical. Some three thousand
odd had suffered before the King came back,
twenty-one dying as a result of cruel treatment.
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
Three hundred died during the Restoration
period, and they were in prison
thousands at a time, for although Charles II.,
once the leaders had made clear their lack of
political ambition, promised them full freedom
from disturbance, the panic of fear of
sectaries of all kinds which followed the
Fifth Monarchy outbreak in London opened
an era of persecution and imprisonment.
Enormous sums of money were extracted
from them under various pretexts; the
Quaker and Conventicle Acts were used
against them with ingenious brutality, an
inducement in the shape of the fine imposed
being held out to informers. The Militia
Act was, of course, a convenient weapon,
and their refusal to pay tithes meant a perpetual
series of heavy distraints. It was a
common trick with judges and magistrates
when they could find no legitimate ground
of complaint, to tender to Quakers the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy and turn them
into law-breakers on the ground of their
refusal to swear. Wales offered the most
ferocious persecution suffered by them in
these islands, but the Welsh converts furnished
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
Pennsylvania with a fine group of
vigorous, industrious colonists.
</p>

<p>
In 1654 the &ldquo;new doctrine&rdquo; was brought
to the South by some sixty travelling missionaries.
The Universities, inflamed, no
doubt, in advance by the report of the Quaker
scorn of wisdom and high &ldquo;notions&rdquo;&mdash;having
already revenged themselves upon four
Quaker girls who were the first to &ldquo;publish
truth&rdquo; in the colleges and churches, Cambridge
following up the savagery of the
students by public flogging, Oxford by
ducking&mdash;had little but rage and evil treatment
for the missionaries. Amongst the
few converts made in Oxford, however, was
the man who, in his turn, brought William
Penn into the Quaker fold. In pious London,
sunk in theological strife, the obscure Waiters,
Ranters, and Seekers were the most favourable
soil.
</p>

<p>
The Quakers, however, worked everywhere,
ploughing up the land, calling men
to cease the strife of words, and to wait
before the Lord for living experience.
</p>

<p>
They had come down in June, and in
August were so far settled as to undertake
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
expansion east and west. The east, a
stronghold of Puritanism, was less receptive
than the western country, where Seekers
abounded and convincements took place by
hundreds.
</p>

<p>
Ireland was broken into by William Edmondson,
an ex-Cromwellian soldier. The
country was in process of being &ldquo;settled&rdquo;
by English colonists, who, most of them being
either Baptists or Independents, were already
a sufficient source of irritation, and the
progress of the new message was slow, and
met with a persecution, borrowing much of
its bitterness from the state of nervous fear
prevailing amongst the civil and military
authorities. For a time there was an attempt
systematically to exclude Friends from the
country, but it gave way before the zeal
and simplicity of the preachers, and Quakerism,
gaining most of its early converts from
the army, became in the end a rapidly expanding
force.
</p>

<p>
In Scotland Quaker teaching progressed
slowly. By 1656 the Continent had been
attacked, Holland and Germany, Austria
and Hungary, Adrianople, where a young
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
girl who had gone out alone reasoned with
the Sultan, and was told that she spoke truth,
and asked to remain in the country; Rome&mdash;where
John Love was given up by the Jesuits
to the Inquisition, examined by the Pope,
and hanged&mdash;the Morea, and Smyrna, and
Alexandria were visited. Many attempts
were made to land at the Levantine ports,
most of which were, however, frustrated by
English consuls and merchants; George
Robinson reached Jerusalem, and came near
to meeting his death at the hands of the
Turks; and the first isolated attempt had
been made in the West Indies and America.
These activities and expansions were helped
forward and confirmed by Fox during the
intervals between his many imprisonments.
He spent altogether some six years in prison.
For the rest, his life was one long missionary
enterprise, and during his detentions he
worked unceasingly.
</p>

<p>
He early recognized the need of a definite
church organization, and matured a system
whose final acceptance by the society as a
whole was helped on by an incident occurring
during his eight months&rsquo; confinement in
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Launceston gaol.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-9" id="fnote-9">[9]</a> James Nayler, one of
the sweetest and ablest of Quaker writers
and preachers, of an acutely &ldquo;suggestible&rdquo;
temperament, and less stable than his
followers, unsettled by the success attending
his work both in the north and the south
and by the adulations of some of the more
excitable of his fellow-workers, permitted
on the occasion of his entry into Bristol a
triumphant procession, the singing of hosannas,
and Messianic worship. It is noteworthy
that of the thousand odd Quakers
in Bristol at the time not one took any part
in the outbreak. The matter was taken
up by Parliament, a committee was appointed,
and Nayler came near being put
to death for blasphemy. He suffered in
the pillory, was whipped through London
and Bristol, his tongue was bored, his
forehead branded, and he was kept in
prison for three years. He made full
public recantation of his errors, and enjoyed
full communion with the society which had
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
never repudiated him, recognizing even in
his time of aberration the fine spiritual character
of the man. This incident, loaded with
publicity, brought much discouragement to
Friends; but it also showed them their need
of the organization and discipline insisted
upon by Fox. And so the Quaker church&mdash;the
most flexible of all religious organizations&mdash;came
into being.

<span class="line1">CHAPTER III</span><br />
<span class="line2">THE QUAKER CHURCH</span>
</h2>

<p class="first">
At the heart of the Quaker church is
&ldquo;meeting&rdquo;&mdash;the silent Quaker meeting so
long a source of misunderstanding to those
outside the body, so clearly illuminated
now for all who care to glance that way,
by the light of modern psychology. We
have now at our disposal, marked out with
all the wealth of spatial terminology characteristic
of that science, a rough sketch of
what takes place in our minds in moments
of silent attention. We are told, for instance,
that when in everyday life our attention
is arrested by something standing out
from the cinematograph show of our accustomed
surroundings, we fix upon this one
point, and everything else fades away to
the &ldquo;margin&rdquo; of consciousness. The
&ldquo;thing&rdquo; which has had the power of so
arresting us, of making a breach in the
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
normal, unnoticed rhythm of the senses,
allows our &ldquo;real self&rdquo;&mdash;our larger and
deeper being, to which so many names have
been given&mdash;to flow up and flood the whole
field of the surface intelligence. The typical
instances of this phenomenon are, of course,
the effect upon the individual of beauty on
all its levels&mdash;the experience known as falling
in love and the experience of &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With most of us, beyond these more or
less universal experiences, the times of
illumination are intermittent, fluctuating,
imperfectly accountable, and uncontrollable.
The &ldquo;artist&rdquo; lives to a greater or
less degree in a perpetual state of illumination,
in perpetual communication with his
larger self. But he remains within the
universe constructed for him by his senses,
whose rhythm he never fully transcends.
His thoughts are those which the veil of
sense calls into being, and though that veil
for him is woven far thinner above the
mystery of life than it is for most of us,
it is there. Imprisoned in beauty, he is
content to dwell, reporting to his fellows
the glory that he sees.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
The religious genius, as represented pre-eminently
by the great mystics&mdash;those in
whom the sense of an ultimate and essential
goodness, beauty, and truth, is the dominant
characteristic&mdash;have consciously bent all
their energies to breaking through the veil
of sense, to making a journey to the heart
of reality, to winning the freedom of the
very citadel of Life itself. Their method has
invariably included what&mdash;again borrowing
from psychology&mdash;we must call the deliberate
control of all external stimuli, a
swimming, so to say, against the whole
tide of the surface intelligence, and this in
no negative sense, no mere sinking into a
state of undifferentiated consciousness, but
rather, as we have seen with Fox, a setting
forth to seek something already found&mdash;something
whose presence is in some way
independent of the normal thinking and
acting creature, something which has already
proclaimed itself in moments of heightened
consciousness&mdash;in the case of the religious
temperament at &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Silence, bodily and mental, is necessarily
the first step in this direction. There is
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
no other way of entering upon the difficult
enterprise of transcending the rhythms of
sense, and this, and nothing else, has been
invariably the first step taken by the mystic
upon his pilgrimage. Skirting chasms of
metaphor, abysses of negation and fear, he
has held along this narrowest of narrow ways.
</p>

<p>
But the early Quakers and the old-time
mystics knew nothing of scientific psychology.
They arrived &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; at their
method of seeking in silence what modern
thought is calling &ldquo;the intuitive principle
of action&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the independent spiritual
life fulfilling itself within humanity&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the
unformulated motive which is the
greater part of mind.&rdquo; Like every seeker,
on whatever level, they were led by
feeling. Feeling passed into action.
Thought followed in due course, and was
deposited as doctrine. They spoke, groping
for symbols, of &ldquo;the seed,&rdquo; &ldquo;the light,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the true birth.&rdquo; In other words&mdash;lest we
go too far with psychology&rsquo;s trinity of
thought, feeling, and will as separable
activities &ldquo;doing the will&rdquo;&mdash;they &ldquo;knew
the doctrine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
From this standpoint of obedience to the
&ldquo;inner light&rdquo; they found within, they
&ldquo;understood&rdquo; what they saw around them,
and brought a fresh revelation to the world.
&ldquo;I was afraid of all company,&rdquo; says Fox
during his early trials, &ldquo;for I saw them
perfectly where they were, through the love
of God which let me see myself.&rdquo; For
them the keynote of life is what an independent
uninstructed French mystic,
Brother Lawrence,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-10" id="fnote-10">[10]</a> has called &ldquo;the practice
of the Presence of God,&rdquo; and the man
to whom the practical spade-work of the
mystics, the art of introversion and contemplation,
the practice (very variously
interpreted) of purgation, the pathway that
leads to &ldquo;unknowing&rdquo; and to union with
what men have called God, has not been
entered on as a matter of living experience,
is no Quaker, no matter how pious,
how philanthropically orthodox, how &ldquo;religious&rdquo;
he may be. In a meeting for
worship he is a foreign body, an unconverted
person.
</p>

<p>
Side by side with the meeting for worship
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
is the business meeting&mdash;a monthly meeting
which is the executive unit of the society.
It is held under the superintendence of a
clerk, whose duty it is to embody the results
of discussions in a series of minutes (voting
and applause are unknown), and to send
these up to the larger quarterly meeting of
the district&mdash;a group of monthly meetings&mdash;delegates
being appointed by each monthly
meeting to secure representation. The
meetings are open to all members and to
outsiders on application. Most local questions
are settled by the quarterly meetings,
whose deliberations are on the same plan as
those of the monthly meetings. Questions
affecting the society as a whole, and matters
otherwise of wide importance, go up to
Yearly Meeting&mdash;the General Assembly of
the Society&mdash;where, as in the subordinate
meetings, decisions are reached by means
of a taking by the clerk of the general
&ldquo;sense&rdquo; of the gathering after free discussion.
The decisions of Yearly Meeting
are final. It issues periodically a Book of
Discipline, in which are embodied, in the
form of epistles and other documents, the
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
general attitude of the society as a whole in
matters of belief and conduct. A number
of sub-committees are perpetually at work
for special ends&mdash;social, philanthropic, etc.&mdash;and
there is attached to Yearly Meeting a
standing committee known as the Meeting
for Sufferings, established in 1675 in the
interest of the victims of persecution. It
is composed of representatives of quarterly
meetings and of certain officers. It is
always engaged in the interest, not only of
members of the Quaker body in difficult
circumstances, but of sufferers all over the
world. It does an enormous amount of
unpublished work. Notorious, of course, is
the history of the party of Quakers who
arrived in Paris on the raising of the siege<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-11" id="fnote-11">[11]</a>
with food and funds for the famine-stricken
town; less known is the constant quiet
assistance, such as that rendered to famine
and plague districts and at the seat of war
in various parts of the world. There are
two offices in the Quaker body: that of
Elder, whose duty it is to use discretion in
acting as a restraining or encouraging influence
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
with younger members in their ministry;
and that of Overseer, exercising a
general supervision over members of their
meeting, admonishing them, if it should be
necessary, as to the payment of just debts;
the friendly settlement of &ldquo;differences&rdquo;
about outward things; the discouraging and,
as far as possible, restraining legal proceedings
between members; &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; with
any who may be conducting themselves,
either in business or in private life, in a
way such as to bring discredit upon their
profession; caring for the poor, securing
maintenance for them where necessary,
and assisting them to educate their children.
When any person has been found to be
specially helpful in a meeting, and his or
her ministry is recognized over a considerable
period of time as being a true
ministry, exercised &ldquo;in the spirit,&rdquo; such a
one is, after due deliberation, &ldquo;acknowledged&rdquo;
or &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; as a &ldquo;minister.&rdquo;
This acknowledgment, however, confers no
special status upon the individual, and
implies no kind of appointment to preach
or otherwise to exercise any special function
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
in the society. There is, apparently, to-day
a growing feeling against even this slight
recognition of ministry as also against the
custom hitherto prevailing of the special
&ldquo;bench&rdquo; for Elders, which is usually on a
raised dais, and facing the meeting. Men
and women work, both in government and in
ministry, side by side. Until the year 1907
they held their Yearly Meeting separately,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-12" id="fnote-12">[12]</a>
with occasional joint sittings. Since then all
Yearly Meetings are held jointly, though
the women&rsquo;s meetings are still held for
certain purposes.
</p>

<p>
The superficial structure of the society
has existed, together with its founder&rsquo;s
system of the methodical recording of births,
marriages, and deaths, much as we know it
to-day from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
The distinctive Quaker teaching&mdash;with
its two main points, the direct communication
of truth to a man&rsquo;s own soul: the presence,
in other words, of a &ldquo;seed of God&rdquo; in every
man; and the possibility here and now of
complete freedom from sin, together with
the many subsidiary testimonies, such as
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
that against war, oaths, the exclusion of
women from the ministry, etc., depending
from these points&mdash;has also survived through
many crises, and, in spite of the perpetual
danger of being overwhelmed by the Calvinism
amidst which it was born, and
which to this day takes large toll of the
society, and perpetually threatens the whole
group, is still represented in its original
purity.
</p>

<p>
The Quakers have never, in spite of their
deprecation of the written word and their
insistence on the secondariness of even the
highest &ldquo;notions&rdquo; and doctrines, been backward
in defending their faith. They sat at
the feet of no man, nor did they desire that
any man should sit at theirs; but when
they met, not merely at the hands of the
wilder sectaries, but from sober, godly
people, with accusations of blasphemy,
when they were told that they denied Christ
and the Scriptures, they rose up and justified
themselves. They were fully equal to
those who attacked them in the savoury
vernacular of the period, in apocalyptic
metaphor, in trouncings and denunciations.
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
Bunyan, their relentless opponent throughout,
is thus apostrophized by Burrough:
&ldquo;Alas for thee, John Bunion! thy several
months&rsquo; travail in grief and pain is a fruitless
birth, and perishes as an untimely fig,
and its praise is blotted out among men, and
it&rsquo;s passed away as smoke.&rdquo; But throughout
the vehemence of the Friends&rsquo; controversial
writings runs the sense of fair play&mdash;the
fearlessness of truth; the spirit, so to
say, of tolerance of every belief in the midst
of their intolerance of an &ldquo;unvital&rdquo; attitude
in the believer. Their positive attitude to
life, their grand affirmation, redeems much
that on other grounds seems regrettable.
</p>

<p>
By the time the classical apologist of
Quakerism&mdash;Robert Barclay, a member of
an ancient Scottish family, liberally educated
at Aberdeen College and in Paris,
who had on his conversion forced himself
to ride through the streets of his city in
sackcloth and ashes&mdash;had published his
book,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-13" id="fnote-13">[13]</a> any justification of Quakerism had,
from the point of view of the laity at large,
ceased to be necessary. They had had
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
some thirty years&rsquo; experience of the fruits
of the doctrine; they knew the Quakers as
neighbours; had scented something of the
sweet fragrance of their austerity; had
wondered at their independence of happenings,
their freedom from fear, their centralized
strength, their picking their way, so
to say, amongst the externalities of life with
the calm assurance of those who hold a
clue where most men blunder, driven by
fear or selfish desire. They knew them,
moreover, as untiringly available outside
their own circle on behalf of every sort of
distress. The custodians, amateur and
official, of theology still preyed upon them,
though many of these were, no doubt,
disarmed by the Puritan orthodoxy of the
background upon which Barclay&rsquo;s rationale
of the Quaker&rsquo;s attitude is wrought.
</p>

<p>
There is ample evidence that he was widely
read, both in England and abroad, and the
fact that no one took up the challenge,
though Baxter and Bunyan were still
living and working, may perhaps be accounted
for by the absence in the <em>Apology</em>
of any clear statement of the real irreconcilability
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
between Quakerism and attitudes
that are primarily doctrinal or institutional.
</p>

<p>
He accepts the scriptures as a secondary
light, saying that they may not be esteemed
the &ldquo;principal ground of all Truth and
Knowledge, nor yet the adequate primary
rule of faith and manners,&rdquo; that they cannot
go before the teaching of the very spirit
that makes them intelligible. He maintains
that the closing adjuration in the Book of
Revelation refers only to that particular
prophecy, and is not intended to suggest
that prophecy is at an end. The ground of
knowledge is immediate revelation, which
may not be &ldquo;subjected to the examination
either of the outward Testimony of the Scripture
or of the Natural Reason of Man as to
a more noble or certain Rule or Touchstone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He considers that Augustine&rsquo;s doctrine of
original sin was called out by his zeal
against the Pelagian exaltation of the
natural light of reason. He admits that
man in sin&mdash;the natural man&mdash;can know no
right; that, therefore, the Socinians and
Pelagians are convicted in exalting a
&ldquo;natural light,&rdquo; but that, nevertheless,
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
God in love gives universal light, convicting
of sin, and teaching if not resisted. He
qualifies the Quaker claim to the possibility
of absolute present salvation from sin
by adding that there may be a falling off.
</p>

<p>
The whole of his argument displays the
impossibility of rationalizing the position
to which the Quakers had felt their way in
terms of the absolute dualism of seventeenth-century
philosophy. He places the
doctrines of natural sinfulness and of universal
light side by side, and so leaves them.
</p>

<p>
The logical instability of Quaker formulas
due to the limitations of the scientific
philosophy of the day (not until the dawn
of our own century has a claim analogous to
theirs been put forward on the intellectual
plane)&mdash;due, in other words, to the characteristic
lagging of thought behind life, while
comparatively immaterial in the founders
and leaders of the Quaker movement, who
were all mystics or mystically minded persons,
a variation of humanity, peculiar
people gathered together, with all their
differences, by a common characteristic,
seeing their universe in the same terms
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
urged towards unanimous activity&mdash;began
to bear fruit in the second generation.
Mystical genius is not hereditary, and to the
comparatively imitative mass making up the
later generations the Inward Light becomes
a doctrine, a conception as mechanical and
static as is the infallible Scripture to the
imitative mass of the Protestants.
</p>

<p>
We may not, of course, apply the term
&ldquo;imitative&rdquo; in too absolute a sense. All
have the light. We are all mystics. We
all live our lives on our various levels, at
first hand. But a full recognition of this
fact need not blind us to the further fact
that, while those who have mystical genius
need no chart upon their journey, most of
us need a plain way traced out for us
through the desert. Most of us follow the
gleam of doctrine thrown out by first-hand
experience, and cling to that as our guide.
But if the Quaker message failed as theology,
and the later generations swung back to
the simpler doctrine of Protestantism and
re-enthroned an infallible Scripture, something,
nevertheless, had been done. Within
the precincts of Quakerism certain paths
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
backwards were, so to say, permanently
blocked. A fresh type of conduct was
assured. The world, the environment in
which the new lives of the group were to
arise, had been changed for ever.
</p>

<p>
The working out of the logical insecurity
of the Quaker position is interestingly
shown in the person of George Keith, intellectually
the richest of the early Quakers,
a man whose writings have been acknowledged
by his fellows, and would still stand
if he had not left the group, as amongst
the best expositions of the Quaker attitude.
</p>

<p>
He was a Scotch Presbyterian, and seems
to have joined the Quakers while still a
student at Aberdeen University. For nearly
thirty years he was under the spell of the
Quaker reading of life, and lived during
this time well in the forefront of public
discussion and persecution. We find him
writing books and pamphlets in and out
of prison, full of the ardour and the joy of
his discovery that there are to-day immediate
revelations, speaking with delight of
the meaning and use of silence, defending
his new faith before Presbyterian divines
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
and University students, declaring that he
found Friends &ldquo;wiser than all the teachers
I ever formerly had been under.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not until after the death of Fox,
when the first generation of &ldquo;born Friends&rdquo;
was growing up, that he began to express
his sense of the danger he saw ahead.
Then we find him accusing Friends of
neglecting the historic evidences of their
faith, of sacrificing the outer to the inner.
His main doctrinal divergence from them was
his assertion that salvation is impossible
without the knowledge of and belief in the
historic Jesus. But doctrine was not his
only difficulty. He went to the very heart
of the situation. He saw that the Quakers
could never become in the world what they
hoped to be&mdash;a mystical church, a body of
men swayed without let or hindrance by
the Divine Spirit, pioneers for the world
upon the upward way&mdash;unless they were
willing to pay the price of the saintly office.
He begged for the abolition of birthright
membership, for an open confession of
faith for incoming members, that the
children of Friends should come and offer
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
themselves as strangers, their spiritual
claims weighed and considered; that marriage
should not be celebrated according
to the Quaker rites between those who
were not faithful Friends; that a sort of
register should be kept of those who, in
and out of meeting, were live and consistent
Christians. His view of the situation,
though put forward with a violence
and bitterness which prejudiced it with his
hearers, and brought his own spiritual life
under suspicion, is largely justified by the
subsequent experience of the society. His
challenge attracted a large following in
America, whither he had gone as headmaster
of a Friends&rsquo; school. The other
leaders of the society, both in London and
Pennsylvania, denied his assertion of the
neglect by Friends of the historical Christ,
while protesting that we must believe that
the light of Christ reaches every man,
whether he have heard of him or no.
</p>

<p>
In 1692 the matter came before the
Yearly Meeting, and Keith and his large
body of followers were condemned in writing
of the &ldquo;spirit of reviling, railing, lying,
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
slandering,&rdquo; and of mischievous and hurtful
separation. So the schism was formed, and
a new sect arose, which established many
meetings amidst controversy and bitterness.
The following year London Yearly Meeting,
considering his case in sittings that sometimes
lasted for days, finally declared him
to have separated himself from the holy
fellowship of the Church of Christ, and disowned
him. His following gradually disappeared.
For some years he travelled
about in America, visiting meetings and
protesting against his disownment. Later
on he became an Independent, then an
Episcopalian. He died as a minister of the
Church of England. There is a story, which
most authorities consider to be well authenticated,
representing him as saying before he
died that if God had taken him while he
was a Quaker, it would have been well with
him.

<span class="line1">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
<span class="line2">THE RETREAT OF QUAKERISM</span>
</h2>

<p class="first">
But the swing-back for the imitative mass
to the easily grasped dogma of an infallible
Scripture did not take place at once. It
appears as a clearly accomplished fact at
the time of the mid-eighteenth-century departure
of Quakerism on its second missionary
effort. Meanwhile, we must consider
the intervening hundred years&mdash;the second
period of Quakerism&mdash;generally known as
the century of Quietism.
</p>

<p>
The first generation of Quakers had passed
away. The great mission&mdash;the going forth
to win mankind to live by the Inner Light&mdash;had
failed. Better fitted, apparently, than
any since the early Christians to evangelize
the world, catholic to the limit of the term,
knowing nothing of &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; nor of any
&ldquo;living in darkness&rdquo;; a body of devotees
culled from all existing groups, hampered
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
by no official church, unhindered by luxury,
undaunted by distance and difficulty, working
in the open under storms of persecution
that had driven their companion groups to
hiding or dissolution, the Friends of Truth
had failed to bring even the churches to
the acknowledgment of that on which they
all ultimately rested. Passing through European
Christendom and beyond, they gathered
in their fellows, retreated to camp, gave
up their original enterprise, and became a
separatist sect. The greater number of
them were flourishing tradespeople, owing
their success in business largely to the fact
that, whereas trade as a whole was still
subject to those passions which had called
forth in old times the law forbidding any
transaction beyond the sum of twenty
pennies to be made without the presence of
the port-reeve or other responsible third
person, here were men who required neither
bond nor agreement, who were as good as
their word, asking one price for their goods,
and refusing to bargain. Their social life at
the beginning of the second period has been
described for us by one of the last of the
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
earlier generation, coming late in life to
English Quaker circles after twenty years
of absence. William Bromfield was a medical
man who had followed James II. to Ireland
because of his goodness to the Quakers, had
served him for years in Paris as his secretary,
and had suffered imprisonment in the
Bastille for conscience&rsquo; sake. At one moment
we see him visiting a Trappist monastery,
explaining to the Fathers the Quaker
faith and manner of living&mdash;the Trappists
acknowledging the Quakers as ripe for
sainthood&mdash;and then we read of his bitter
disillusionment. He finds<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-14" id="fnote-14">[14]</a> &ldquo;riches, pride,
arrogancy, and falling into parties.&rdquo; He
notes with grief that onlookers are saying
<a id="corr-1"></a>&ldquo;that the Quakers, who might have converted
the world had they kept their first faith, are
now become apostates and hypocrites, as
vain in their Conversation, Habits, and
Dresses, as any other people.&rdquo; Even the
poor tradesmen and mechanics amongst
them wore periwigs: &ldquo;a wicked covering
of Horse-hair and Goats&rsquo;-hair.&rdquo; Men were
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
&ldquo;trick&rsquo;d out in cock&rsquo;d Hats, their fine
Cloathes with their Cuts <em> la mode</em> and long
cravats.&rdquo; Women went about with &ldquo;bare
neck, Hoop&rsquo;d Petticoats, Lac&rsquo;d Shoes,
Clock&rsquo;t Hose, Gold-chains, Lockets, Jewels,
and fine Silks.&rdquo; Seeing in these characteristics
of the main mass of the second generation
nothing but the ravages of laxity, the
faithful nucleus of the society determined
on a measure of reform. A missionary
party, with full powers to this end, went
forth in 1760 from London Yearly Meeting.
In every separate meeting throughout the
country wayward members were dealt with.
Many were reclaimed; those who showed
themselves either stubborn or indifferent
were expelled from the society. Disownment
for marriage outside the group dates
from this time, and it has been estimated
that by this means alone the membership
was reduced by one-third.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the remnant the Quaker testimonies
against extravagance in dress, unprofitable
occupations and amusements,
and advices as to simplicity in manners,
were stereotyped into a code, and became
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
matters of strict observance. It is from
this middle period that the popular picture
of Quakerism is borrowed. The Quakers
went forward from their great purgation&mdash;a
strictly closed sect, carefully guarded from
outside influence, the younger generations
forced either to conform to the traditional
pattern or to suffer banishment&mdash;depleted
and decreasing until the time of the modern
revival taking place about the middle of
the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
The deductions made by modern commentators
from these data fall into two groups.
</p>

<p>
There is the view held generally by those
standing outside the body, whether enemies
or friends, that Quakerism comes to an end
with its heroic period. The first recognize
its initial catholicity, rejoice in its successful
tilting with Puritan Protestantism, but see
it foredoomed by its heresies, by its neglect
of the outward symbols of the sanctification
of human life, and by the deleterious effect of
the admission of women into the ministry.
The sympathizers see the early Quakers
either as the glory of seventeenth-century
Christianity or the left wing of a widespread
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
effort to democratize formal religion&mdash;a
shifting of the centre of authority from the
official custodian to the man himself. They
come regretfully upon the undisciplined
ranks of the second generation. They have
no faith in the movement for reform; for
them the little church of the Spirit dwindles,
lit with a faint sunset glow of romance down
towards extinction. All, both enemies and
friends, who see Quakerism end with the
seventeenth century, dispose of the modern
revival by placing it within the general
movement of Protestant evangelicalism.
</p>

<p>
The second group of deductions appears
to be shared by the Quakers themselves in
so far as their present literary output is
representative of the feelings and opinions
of the body. They appear to attribute their
failure to capture the world, on the one
hand, to their exclusion from the main
stream of thought and culture, and, on
the other, to the inability of the early
protagonists to present a formulation of
their central doctrine free from contradictions,
to their subjection to the dualistic
philosophy of the day, which saddles their
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
teaching of the Inner Light with a tendency to
neglect all external means of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
Beyond these two most usual readings of
the early history of Quakerism, we find the
more recent apologists of Christian mysticism,
while freely admitting the Quakers
into the fellowship of the mystics, dispose
inferentially of the possibility of the
&ldquo;free&rdquo; mystical church of which Friends
dreamed on the ground of the rarity of the
religious&mdash;the still greater rarity of the
mystical temperament. In their opinion
the art and science of religion will always be
carried on by specialists; the torch-bearers
will be few, though their light illumine
the pathway of the world. A world-church,
therefore&mdash;a church which must cast her wings
over all in her striving to turn all towards the
light&mdash;must organize primarily in the interest
of conduct as an end. In this view the
Quaker system, in so far as it invites every
man to be his own church, must always fail.
</p>

<p>
We may, perhaps, accept something of
all these readings; we may recognize the
unsuitability for the daily need of the world
at large of a church neither primarily institutional
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
nor primarily doctrinal. We may
admit, for many minds in a Christendom
generally ignorant of its own history of an
episcopally ordained and invested female
clergy, the handicap of recognized feminine
ministry; we may see the full unreason of
birthright membership, and the change
of base in the modern revival, without,
perhaps, being driven to conclude that
England&rsquo;s attempt to introduce into field and
market-place the hitherto cloistered mystical
faith and practice has entirely failed.
</p>

<p>
For amidst the stereotyped Puritanism of
this middle period, with its fear of beauty,
its suspicion of all pursuits not directly
utilitarian or devotional, saints were born.
The century which produced John Woolman
and the men and women who initiated and
took the lion&rsquo;s share in the movement for
the abolition of slavery; which supplied to
the cause of science and to the medical profession,
in spite of exclusion from the main
streams of learning, eminent men<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-15" id="fnote-15">[15]</a> in
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
numbers quite out of proportion to the size
of the group; which saw the blossoming of
public education in the form of the fine
Quaker schools where girls and boys were
educated side by side,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-16" id="fnote-16">[16]</a> must have been rich
in inarticulate and unrecorded saintly lives.
</p>

<p>
There must have been in the sober Quaker
homes, where affection ruled without softness,
where love was heroic rather than
sentimental, many who followed, not as
imitators, but with all the strength of an
original impulse the pathway chosen by
those who have been willing to pay the
price of an enhanced spiritual life; the withdrawal,
in varying measure, from the values
and standards accepted by the world at large.
They kept watch. They worked amongst
their fellows in a dusk between memory and
anticipation. They felt to the uttermost and
fought to the uttermost the weakness of the
self. They were faithful, and in due time the
society as a whole felt the breath of revival.

<span class="line2">QUAKERISM IN AMERICA</span>
</h2>

<p class="first">
The American colonies seemed to the early
leaders of the Quaker movement to offer at
once a field for the free development of
their faith and a base whence they might
spread to the ends of the earth. The possibility
of buying land from the Indians was
being discussed in the society as early as
1660. But though, it is true, Quaker influence
was decisive in establishing religious
toleration in America, though the relationship
between the native tribes and the
colonists was transformed through their
substitution of unarmed treaty parties for
the existing methods of intimidation and
of strictly fair dealing for dishonesty and contract-breaking,
though they initiated and took
the lion&rsquo;s share in the abolition of slavery,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-17" id="fnote-17">[17]</a>
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
and established the precedent of a State
founded on brotherly love, although they did
more than any other group of refugees or
body of colonists to settle the foundations
of the religious and civil life of the country;
yet the texture of the religious life of the
American people is to-day largely Puritan
Protestantism, and of the Quaker influence
in government there remains not a trace.

For more than half a century after the
savage persecution<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-18" id="fnote-18">[18]</a> by the Puritans&mdash;reaching
its fullest fury in Boston under Governor
Endicott&mdash;had come to an end, Quakerism
was a steadily growing power in America.
</p>

<p>
The Quakers flourished in Rhode Island,
to whom they supplied many Governors,
and where at one time they were continually
in office; they made fair headway in Connecticut.
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
In Long Island their establishment
was finally secured by the advice of
the Dutch home Government on the ground
of their excellence as citizens. They
achieved a foothold in Virginia in face of
the indignant persecutions of the Episcopalians.
Their history in Maryland is an
excellent illustration of the nature of their
work on behalf of religious toleration.
When, in 1691, an Act was framed to secure
the establishment of the Protestant church,
the Quakers, who were by this time both
numerous and influential in the colony,
laboured in opposition to it until they
brought the bill to nought. They supported
the Catholics in their struggle for
emancipation, and were largely instrumental
in securing the repeal, in 1695, of
the Act against them. They also joined
with Rome to prevent the Episcopalian
Church from being established by law, but
in this they were only partially successful.
In the Carolinas they appear to have fared
well. For years, though in a minority,
they controlled the government. New
Jersey was thrown open to them by a large
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
purchase of land. William Penn&rsquo;s share in
this transaction was the beginning of his
practical interest in America, finally to
express itself in the foundation of the
Quaker State of Pennsylvania,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-19" id="fnote-19">[19]</a> which was
very largely his own work. His labours as a
religious apologist, filling some five volumes,
and representing in his graceful, polished
style the application to social life of the
Puritan morality upon which the Quakers
had grafted their beliefs, are secondary to
his work in America, for which he gave up
all he possessed&mdash;influence, the prospect of
a brilliant career at home, friends, fortune,
and health.
</p>

<p>
This colony, bought strip by strip in
honest treaty with the Indians, developed
more quickly than any other. It was a
home for refugees of every shade of opinion.
Friends at no time formed more than half
the population, but their influence was
supreme.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
Two years after the settlement of the
State<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-20" id="fnote-20">[20]</a> Penn writes that two general assemblies
had been held with such concord
and despatch that they sat but three weeks,
and at least seventy laws were passed without
one dissent in any material thing.
</p>

<p>
For thirty years there was peace, liberty,
and refuge for all, and an unrivalled prosperity.
We may picture Penn, in the days
of witch crazes, holding his one trial of a
witch, and establishing the precedent of
finding the woman guilty of the common
fame of being a witch, but not guilty as
indicted; and in another characteristically
Friendly moment refusing, when greatly in
need of funds, six thousand pounds for a
trade monopoly which would have violated
his principle of fairness to the Indians. Free
thought was encouraged, and a little group
of distinguished men appeared in Philadelphia.
The final downfall of Friendly
administration in Pennsylvania was the
result of the refusal on the part of the
majority of the Quakers to adjust their
principles to the demand sent to the Quaker
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
legislature for means to proceed against the
French and the Indians.
</p>

<p>
Up to the time of this occurrence it had
seemed as if America were on the way to
becoming an autonomous province of the
British Empire, steered by Quaker principles.
Privilege after privilege had been
quietly secured by Penn from the home
government, and it is not difficult to believe
that if on the eve of the Revolution negotiations
had been left in Friendly hands, the
war of separation need not have taken place.
When it broke out, the Quakers retired decisively
from legislative and municipal positions.
A Quakerized liberty party carried
on the traditions of civil liberty up to the
last moment. The Scotch-Irish Presbyterians,
who despised the Quakers, and
treated the Indians as heathen to be exterminated,
formed the main body of the
Pennsylvanian revolutionary party.
</p>

<p>
Friends suffered under English taxation,
and their principles prevented them from
smuggling, yet they opposed not merely
warfare, but revolution, disowning those
who supported it, and reiterated their
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
loyalty to England. They were arrested
and imprisoned as friends of the British,
their goodly farms and their meeting-houses
were placed at the mercy of troopers and
foragers, whose pay they would not accept.
Their decent streets were demoralized.
They went quietly about their business as
best they might, pursuing, even while the
war was in progress, their labours in the aid
of drunkards and slaves, their succour of
the uneducated.
</p>

<p>
They built schools for the negroes, and
when, after the revolution was at an end
(whereupon they duly suffered at the hands
of the rejoicing multitude), there came
the scandal of the &ldquo;walking purchase&rdquo; of
land from the Indians and the fear of a
serious outbreak, they formed a private
association and pacified the Indians, preventing
warfare at the cost to themselves
of weeks of negotiation and the sum of five
thousand pounds paid by them. Incidents
of this type occur again and again in Quaker
history, and are practical proof of the fact
that their avoidance of the spirit of strife, so
often present in political life, was no kind of
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
timidity, of passive resistance, or comfortable
retirement from the business of the world.
Least of all was it indifference to what went
forward in the public affairs of the nation.
</p>

<p>
Apart from its temporary dominion of
&ldquo;affairs,&rdquo; American Quakerism follows much
the same line of development as does the
movement at home. The original impulse
tends to be superseded for the imitative
mass by a doctrine embodied in an institution;
the dogma of the Inner Light becomes
dangerously absolutist. There is a
corresponding return to the steadying refuge
of an infallible scripture, and the modern
church, while still united and distinguishable
by the marks of Quaker culture, of
faith and practice, kindling here and there
to the older insight and vision, shows a
divided front.
</p>

<p>
In 1827 a large group&mdash;now known as
Hicksites&mdash;separated under Elias Hicks,
whose repudiation of doctrines and creeds,
and insistence on right living, resulted, in
the opinion of &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Friends, in a
wrong attitude towards Christ and the
scriptures. The evangelical reaction in
<a id="page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
England, which was, in part, a result of
the Hicksite controversy, brought about a
further division in America under John
Wilbur, who protested against Evangelical
biblicism, and reasserted the doctrine of
the Inner Light, insisted on plainness of
speech and dress, and looked with suspicion
upon &ldquo;art.&rdquo; The orthodox group, deeply
tinged with Protestant evangelicalism, have
largely adopted the pastoral system. There
are now at least four distinct groups in
America.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-21" id="fnote-21">[21]</a>

<span class="line2">QUAKERISM AND WOMEN</span>
</h2>

<p class="first">
Watching pilgrims who pass one by
one along the mystic way, we see both
women and men. Teresa, Catharine, Elizabeth,
Mechthild, no less than Francis,
Tauler, Boehme, stand as high peaks of
human achievement in entering into direct
relationship with the transcendental life.
But when we reach the humbler levels of
institution and doctrine, the religious genius
of womanhood tends to be pushed, so to
say, into an oblique relationship. Under
organized Christianity, and particularly
under Protestantism, has this been so.
Amongst the first Christians, it is true,
women preached and prophesied. There
is, moreover, in the history of the early
centuries sound evidence of an ordained
and invested female clergy. Taking that
history as a whole, however, women have
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
been, and are still, excluded from the
councils of the churches and from the responsibilities
and privileges of priesthood.
Devout churchwomen, and, in particular,
devout Protestants, are nourished on literal
interpretation of records, which assure them
of an essential inferiority to their male
companions, and enjoin subjection in all
things. At marriage, they sacramentally
renounce individuality. Quakerism stands
as the first form of Christian belief, which
has, even in reaching its doctrinized and
institutionized levels, escaped regarding
woman as primarily an appendage to be
controlled, guided, and managed by man.
This escape was the result, not of any kind
of feminism, any sort of special solicitude
for or belief in women as a class. Nor was
it the result of a protest against any definitely
recognized existing attitude. Such unstable
and fluctuating emotions could not have
carried through the Quaker reformation of
the relations of the sexes. The recognition
of the public ministry of women was an act
of faith. It was a step that followed from
a central belief in the universality of the
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
inner light. It was taken in the face of
difficulties. It hampered the Quakers enormously
in relation to the outside world. It
was the occasion of profound disturbance
within the body. Heart-searching and hesitation
rose here and there to an opposition
so convinced as to form part of the programme
of the first schismatics.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-22" id="fnote-22">[22]</a> Fox had
to fight valiantly. His central belief once
clear, he cut clean through the Pauline
tangle of irreconcilable propositions, and
forged from the depths of his conviction
phrases that would, were they but known,
do yeoman service in the present agitation
for the release of the artificially inhibited
responsibilities of women. He is never
tired of reminding those who cling to the
story of the Fall that the restoration of
humanity in the appearance of Christ took
the reproach from woman. He rallies men,
often with delicious humour, on their desire
to rule over women, and exhorts those who
despise &ldquo;the spirit of prophecy in the
daughters&rdquo; to be &ldquo;ashamed for ever.&rdquo; But
although faith won, it is probable that the
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
majority took the step only under the
urgency of deep-seated consciousness, the
surface intelligence still loudly asserting
the necessary pre-eminence of masculine
standards. Even amongst the most determined
advocates of the recognition of a
woman&rsquo;s spiritual identity, amongst those
who condemned its suppression as blasphemous,
we meet the suggestion that this
recognition need not in any way interfere
with her proper subjection to her husband.
Nevertheless, Fox succeeded in equalizing
the marriage covenant.
</p>

<p>
The government of the society, therefore,
was for many years carried on by men alone,
a women&rsquo;s meeting coming into existence, as
we have seen, only when obviously imperative&mdash;in
relation to the care of the women
and children suffering under persecution&mdash;and
persisting only for special purposes
quite apart from the business of the society
as a whole. Men and women, however,
occasionally visited each other&rsquo;s meetings,
and joint sittings were sometimes held.
</p>

<p>
It was the experience coming to the support
of dawning theory, of the superior
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
working of these joint meetings, that finally
enfranchised Quaker womanhood.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that one of the
most striking features of the technique of
Quaker meetings, whether for business or
worship, is the working out of the distinctive
characteristics of the sexes. Their
contradiction, and the tendency psychology
has roughly summarized of women, as a
class, to control thought by feeling, and of
men, as a class, to allow &ldquo;reason&rdquo; the first
place, is here at its height.
</p>

<p>
The two rival and ever-competing definitions
of reality both find expression.
Each must tolerate the other. Reaction
takes place without bitterness. Again and
again there is revealed the fruitfulness of
that spirit which believes in and seeks
goodness, beauty, and truth&mdash;these alone,
and these in all. Recent statistics have
shown<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-23" id="fnote-23">[23]</a> that women, though always numerically
superior in the society, have supplied
a comparatively small number of both
officers and ministers, and of clerks relatively
none, and that, moreover, this deficit
<a id="page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
is gradually increasing, and is not made
good by any sufficiently compensating output
of public work outside the society.
</p>

<p>
It has been suggested that we may presume,
in consideration of these facts, that
women Friends have by this time availed
themselves of their opportunity to the full
extent of their capacities, and that the result,
as far as government is concerned, is
that the conduct of large public meetings is
almost entirely entrusted to men.
</p>

<p>
In the correspondence that followed the
publication of the statistics certain modifying
statements were made. It was suggested
that of late years the increasing
membership had brought in women who were
without the Quaker tradition&mdash;a fact which
would account for the growing deficit of
feminine activities. Attention was also
drawn to the unseen mass of feminine initiative,
the result of which is credited to men.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, evident that if we begin
by assuming that equality of opportunity
shall result in identity of function, if we
believe, moreover, that government is merely
a matter of machinery, and ministry can be
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
estimated by the counting of heads and of
syllables, we shall be led to the conclusion
that, while the more obvious results of the
Quaker experiment may do something towards
disarming haunting fears as to the
safety of acknowledging the full spiritual
and temporal fellowship of women, it does
comparatively little to justify the claims
and expectations of the feminists in general.
</p>

<p>
But whatever standard we apply, however
we may choose to approach the question
of the public ministry of women;
however, further, we may estimate the value
of the fact that all the practical business of
the society is talked out in their hearing,
that measures are sometimes initiated,
sometimes abolished, invariably commented
on, modified and steered by them, we cannot
form any idea of what Quakerism has
done for women or women for Quakerism
without some consideration of an aspect of
the matter hitherto almost entirely neglected
by historians and commentators,
which yet, in the opinion of the present
writer, may be claimed not only as giving
some part of the explanation of the relative
<a id="page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
inactivity of women in the more obvious
transactions of the society, but as being a
very substantial part of the clue to the
rapid development and the healthy persistence
of Quaker culture&mdash;and that is
the profound reaction upon women of the
changed conditions of home-life; for amongst
the Quakers the particularized home, with
its isolated woman cut off from any responsible
share in the life of &ldquo;the world&rdquo;
and associating mainly with other equally
isolated women, is unknown. A woman
born into a Quaker family inherits the tradition
of a faith which is of the heart rather
than of the head, of intuition rather than
intellectation, of life primarily rather than
of doctrine; and, therefore, it would seem
particularly suited to the development of
her religious consciousness; and she comes,
moreover, into an atmosphere where her
natural sense of direct relationship to life,
her instinctive individual aspiration and
sense of responsibility, instead of being
either cancelled or left dormant, or thwarted
and trained to run, so to say, indirectly, is
immediately confirmed and fostered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
She is in touch with, has, as we have seen,
her stake and her responsibility in regard
to every single activity of the meeting of
which she is a member. Through every
meeting and through every home, moreover,
there is the cleansing and ventilating
ebb and flow of the life of the whole society,
and this not merely by means of the circulation
of matter relating to the deliberations
and the work of the society, but also in the
form of personal contact. Beyond the exchange
of hospitality in connection with
monthly and quarterly meetings for worship
and for business, there is a constant flow of
itinerating ministers and others of both
sexes between meetings either on special
individual concerns or in the interest of
some single branch of the society&rsquo;s work.
</p>

<p>
Simple easy intercourse between family
and family, meeting and meeting, is part of
the fabric of Quaker home-life. Perhaps for
this reason, perhaps just because amongst
the Quakers, in a very true and deep sense,
the world is home and home is the world,
because, in other words, the inner is able
without obstruction to flow out and realize
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
itself in the outer, the sense of family-life,
of home, and fireside, is particularly sweet
and strong. The breaking of family ties is
rare. The failure that leads to the divorce
court is practically unknown.
</p>

<p>
We may look with wonder and admiration
at the great figures amongst Quaker women,
upon those who built their lives into the
first spreadings of the message; upon those
who went, under the urgency of their faith,
alone into strange lands, where means of
communication were the scantiest; upon the
persecuted and martyred women, the
women of initiative and organizing genius;
upon Anne Knight of Chelmsford pioneering
female suffrage in England, founding the
first political association for women; upon
Elizabeth Fry, after a full career as house-keeper,
mother, and social worker, turning,
late in life, to the prisons of England, and
transforming them, so to say, with her own
hands. But, perhaps, it is in the daily
home-life of the society that the distinctively
feminine side of doctrinized and organized
Quakerism reaches its fairest development.

<span class="line2">THE PRESENT POSITION</span>
</h2>

<p class="first">
The counter-agitation<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-24" id="fnote-24">[24]</a> brought forth in
England by the American Hicksite movement,
ended, after prolonged discussion and
stress, in a decisive readjustment of the
Society of Friends. There were numerous
secessions into the Evangelical church and the
Plymouth Brotherhood. There were separations
of those who followed Elias Hicks in
his repudiation of doctrines and creeds, and
of those who favoured Wilbur in protesting
against &ldquo;book religion,&rdquo; reasserting the
doctrines of the Quaker fathers, and insisting
on simplicity of life; but the society
as a whole was swept forward, under the
leadership of Joseph John Gurney (brother of
Elizabeth Fry), by the invading wave of Protestant
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
evangelicalism. Gurney, coming of
old Quaker stock, though religious and pious
and full of zeal for the salvation of the world,
never grasped the essentials of Quakerism.
He had no touch of the intuitive genius
which makes the mystic. Every line he
has written betrays the Protestant biblicist,
the man who puts the verbal revelation
before any other whatsoever. He did not
repudiate the Fathers, but he denied that
they had ever questioned the supreme
authority of the scriptures as the guide of
mankind.
</p>

<p>
His strong persuasive personality revived
the enthusiasm of the imitative mass
of the society, and once more the Quakers
faced the world. It was a new world. The
religious liberty Friends had prophesied
and worked towards had come at last.
The Test Act had been repealed. Nonconformists
were admitted to Parliament
and to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
The London University had been
established. The emerging Quakers, on
their side, began to break down the barriers
they had erected between themselves and
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
the world by their peculiarities of speech
and of dress, and showed a tendency to
relax their hostility towards &ldquo;art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were a little band, tempered and
disciplined by their century of quiet cultivation
of the Quaker faith and method, and
they were at once available for a share,
strikingly disproportionate to their numbers,
in the evangelical work of an awakening
Christendom. From the time of their emergence
their missionary labours have been
unremitting. They engaged in prison reform
and the reform of the penal code.
They initiated the reform of the lunacy laws,
working for the substitution of kindly
treatment in special institutions<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-25" id="fnote-25">[25]</a> for the
orthodox method of chains and imprisonment.
They began to educate the poor.
The foundation of their Foreign Missions
dates from this period of revival.
</p>

<p>
They have widening centres of missionary
work in India, Madagascar, Syria,
China, and Ceylon. They have been the
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
main movers in the work of abolishing the
opium traffic, and are engaged, both at
home and abroad, in all the many well-known
efforts towards social amelioration,
amongst which, perhaps, the leading part
they have taken in experimental philanthropy,
in educational method (their co-education
schools scattered over the country
are models of method, standing for common
sense, humanity, and a wise use of modern
resources), in the housing and betterment
of the lot of the working classes, and in the
establishment of garden suburbs, are particularly
worthy of mention.
</p>

<p>
From their Sunday-school work, begun in
Bristol in 1810, and gradually spreading
over the country, has arisen what is perhaps
the most widely influential of the
present activities in which Friends are
interested on behalf of the working classes&mdash;the
Adult School Movement. Originally
initiated<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-26" id="fnote-26">[26]</a> in the interest of loafers at street
corners, it has now become a national movement,
with a complete organization, upwards
of a thousand schools, and a membership
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
in its ninetieth thousand. It is spreading
on the Continent and in America. At the
meetings of its weekly classes, which are
open to all who care to attend (the men&rsquo;s
and women&rsquo;s classes are held independently),
led by an elected president, who may be an
adherent of any creed or of none, part of
the time is devoted to the consideration of
religious questions and part to lecturettes,
debates, readings, and so on. Each school
develops secondary interests and engages in
special work.
</p>

<p>
Within the society from which this perpetual
stream of evangelical work flows
forth we must distinguish two distinct types
of religious culture. There is, first of all,
the main mass, differing only in its method
of worship from the main body of Protestant
nonconformity&mdash;taking, as we have said, its
stand first and foremost upon the scriptures.
In most Quaker meetings to-day this typically
&ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; attitude predominates
numerically. But while we recognize this
state of affairs as one of the inevitable consequences
of any endeavour to found an
&ldquo;open&rdquo; church upon a mystical basis, it
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
is, nevertheless, amongst the Quakers, modified,
to a certain extent, in two ways: first,
by its subjection to its environment, the
framework of the old Quaker culture, the
training implied in Fox&rsquo;s method both of
private and public worship, in the expectation
of unmediated Divine leadership in all
the circumstances of life, the training in
freedom from the domination of formul
and deductions, the insistence on the important
meaning of the individual soul.
</p>

<p>
It is modified, in the second place, by
the nucleus of genuine mystical endowment,
which has persisted through the centuries
at the heart of the Quaker church, both
handed down in the direct line and coming
in from without; the remnant whose influence
has so often made this little church
the sorting-house, so to say, amongst the
sects for mystically minded persons. And
during the last ten years&mdash;the years which
have seen such a striking revival of the
interest in mysticism, have felt a clearing
and a growth of the recognition of the importance
to the race as a whole of mystical
genius, have produced a mass of seriously
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
undertaken studies of this phenomenon
from every point of approach&mdash;the Quaker
church has continued increasingly to fulfil
this function. Not only from the sects,
but from the older establishments, and from
the ranks of religiously unclassified &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;
and &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; there is a steady
migration towards the Quaker fold.
</p>

<p>
The vitality of this modern Quaker group
is expressing itself at the present time in a
twofold activity over and above the home
and foreign missionary work we have already
noted. This activity is visible throughout
the society, both in England and in America.
There is, on the one hand, an effort emanating
from the more intellectual section of the
group, to express Quakerism in terms of
modern thought, to reach, as far as may be,
with the help of modern psychology, a
philosophical &ldquo;description&rdquo; of the doctrine
of the &ldquo;inner light&rdquo;&mdash;a description which
is thought to be much more possible to-day
than it was at the time of George Fox.
This effort, which includes the rewriting in
detail and from original documents of the
history of the Society of Friends, is embodied
<a id="page-88" class="pagenum" title="88"></a>
in the work of a little group of Quaker
writers, prominent amongst whom are the
late John Wilhelm Rowntree, the late Miss
Caroline E. Stephen, Dr. Rufus M. Jones,
Mr. William C. Braithwaite, Mr. Edward
Grubb, and Miss Joan M. Fry. Mr. Edward
Grubb,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-27" id="fnote-27">[27]</a> perhaps one of the most illuminating
of the Quaker writers upon the doctrine of
the Inner Light, realizes with perfect clearness
that the dogma of the Infallible Spirit
presents at least as many difficulties as that
of an infallible Church or Bible; that in
the case of either of these infallibilities the
question immediately arises as to &ldquo;<em>who</em>&rdquo; is
the infallible interpreter? Fox, he points
out, trusted urgency and unaccountability
by mere thought processes for the sign of
the higher source. He adds to this that
&ldquo;the spirit in one man must be tested by
the spirit in many men. The individual
must read his inward state in the light of
the social spiritual group,&rdquo; ... and thus
reaches a sort of spiritual democracy. On
the whole, however, his appeal is to idealism
as the supplanter of materialism; he claims
<a id="page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
thought as the <em>prius</em> of knowledge, and
identifies consciousness with thought. He
leaves us with the &ldquo;notional&rdquo; God of
transcendental idealism, who is just as far
off as the corresponding matter-and-force
God of consistent materialism.
</p>

<p>
Mr. William C. Braithwaite is, perhaps,
happier. &ldquo;The consciousness,&rdquo; he says in
<em>Spiritual Guidance in Quaker Experience</em>,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-28" id="fnote-28">[28]</a>
&ldquo;that our subjective impression of guidance
needs correction to allow for the personal
factor, and the sense that truth of all kinds
and in all ages is harmoniously related,
naturally point to the great advantage of
co-ordinating the light that has come to our
souls with the light that has come to others
in our own day or in past ages. This is not
the same thing as merely relying on tradition
or accepting an experience second-hand;
nor does it mean that we refuse to accept
any guidance which goes beyond the experience
of others&mdash;it means simply that over
the country we have to traverse there are
many paths already trodden along which we
may have safe and speedy passage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
Professor Rufus Jones, who has done
much in relation to the psychology of
Quakerism, also voices the corporate idea
in declaring that the Friend must test his
light by the larger revelation of his co-believers,
and they, again, by the larger
revelation which has come to prophets and
apostles, saints and martyrs; but here,
again, we seem to find ourselves within a
circle of ideas. In place of the simple
homely imagery of Fox, &ldquo;the seed,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
light,&rdquo; the &ldquo;new birth,&rdquo; &ldquo;that which hath
convinced you,&rdquo; we have in these modern
descriptions, it is true, all the rich and
intricate spatial terminology of modern
science; but, so far, the most successful
efforts in the direction of &ldquo;description&rdquo; of
mystical religion in modern terms have not
come from the society, where the belief in,
and the attempt to live in sole dependence
upon, the indwelling spirit is still, for very
many of its members, the single aim, where
there are still many with whom &ldquo;knowing&rdquo;
is more important than &ldquo;knowing about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boldest and clearest sighted, the most
comprehensive and lucid descriptions of the
<a id="page-91" class="pagenum" title="91"></a>
mystic type, of his distinctive genius, his
aim and method, his kinship with his
fellows throughout the ages, the world-old
record of his search and its justification,
are to be found elsewhere.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-29" id="fnote-29">[29]</a>
</p>

<p>
Side by side with the attempt to rationalize
and restate in terms of modern thought the
faith that is in them is a movement enrolling
growing numbers, particularly of younger
Friends, in both continents, in the direction
of expressing Quakerism in terms of modern
life.
</p>

<p>
Home life, social life, business life, every
modern development, is brought to the test
of Quaker principles. There is a spirit
abroad declaring that Quakerism has become
devitalized; that the religious life is stereotyped
and perfunctory; that the joyous, all-conquering
zeal of the early Friends was
the outcome of a secret unknown to their
followers; that the way to the fount at
which they were sustained is lost&mdash;that it
may be found again if the daily life is
<a id="page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
brought under Divine control. A call has
gone forth to sacrifice, to scale the heights
of right living in that purer air, that the
sight may grow clear.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere in Quakerdom we meet this
question as to the secret of the early Quakers.
Do we read in this outcry an admission of
the failure of group mysticism as it has so
far been attempted by the Society of
Friends? The little church of the spirit
seems to be at the turning of the ways.
</p>

<p>
All barriers are down. The rationale of
primitive Quakerism is fully established.
The Quakers no longer stand facing an outraged
or indifferent Christendom. The principles
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by their founder are
conceded in theory by the religious world as
a whole.
</p>

<p>
Will they remain in their present position,
which may be described as that of a Protestant
Ethical Society, with mystical traditions
and methods, part of an organized
and nationalized world-church, suffering the
necessary limitations of a body thrown open
to all, converted and unconverted, committed
to the necessity of teaching doctrinal
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
&ldquo;half-truths,&rdquo; organizing necessarily in the
interest of conduct as an end? or will they
constitute themselves an order within, and
co-operating with, the church&mdash;an order of
lay mystics, held together externally by the
sane and simple discipline laid down by Fox,
and guarded thus from the dangers to which
mysticism is perennially open; an order of
men and women willing corporately to
fulfil, while living in the daily life of the
world, the conditions of revelation, and admitting
to membership only those similarly
willing; a &ldquo;free&rdquo; group of mystics ready
to pay the price, ready to travel along
the way trodden by all their predecessors,
by all who have truly yearned for the
uncreated Light?

NOTE
</h2>

<p class="first">
The bulk of Quaker literature falls into two
main groups: (1) The voluminous writings
of the early Quakers&mdash;journals, epistles,
doctrinal works, and controversial matter&mdash;most
of which were issued under the censorship
of a body of Friends meeting in London,
while a large mass of unprinted manuscripts
and transcripts of manuscripts, admirably
classified and indexed, is available
at the headquarters of the Society, Devonshire
House, Bishopsgate, whose library
contains also the largest collection of books
relating to the Society; (2) the modern output
of history, commentary, expository,
apology, and evangelistic writing.
</p>

<p>
Most of the printed works of George Fox
have been collected in the eight volumes of
the Philadelphia edition. A considerable
quantity is still in manuscript. The Cambridge
edition of his Journal is particularly
interesting in having been printed unaltered
from the original manuscript. It is incomplete,
and is best supplemented by the
bi-centenary edition (see <a href="#chapter-0-11">Bibliography</a>).

on Quaker lines in 1808, the present Saffron Walden
School opened in Islington in 1811, and several others
since both in England and Ireland, all now open to the
general public.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a class="footnote" href="#fnote-17" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> As early as 1657, and before he had come in contact
with slavery, Fox addressed a letter of advice
from England to all slave-holding Friends. In 1671,
seeing for himself the system at work in Barbadoes,
he recommended that the holders should free their
slaves after a term of service, and should arrange
for their welfare when freed. The first documentary
protest against slavery put forward by any religious
body came from the German Quakers in Philadelphia
(Germantown); they had come as settlers from
Kirchheim in Germany, where Penn&rsquo;s teaching had met
with an ardent response. John Woolman spent twenty
years in ceaseless labour on behalf of the slaves.
Throughout the society the work went on; meetings
were held, individual protests were made, slave-holding
Friends were visited. By 1755 it was generally
agreed that negroes should be neither bought nor
imported by Friends, and less than thirty years later
the society, with the exception of a few isolated and
difficult cases, was free of slavery. Many Friends paid
their slaves for past services, and in all cases provision
was made for their welfare.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a class="footnote" href="#fnote-18" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> The first Quakers to reach America were two
women, Anne Austin and Mary Fisher. When they
arrived at Boston, their luggage was searched, their
books were burned in the market-place by the hangman;
they were stripped and examined for signs of
witchcraft, and after five weeks&rsquo; imprisonment and
cruelty were shipped back to Barbadoes. Then
followed a series of persecutions too horrible to be
detailed, increasing in severity from fines&mdash;fireless,
bedless, and almost foodless&mdash;imprisonment in chains
in the Boston winter, floggings (one part alone of the
punishment of the aged William Brand consisted of
117 blows on his bare back with a barred rope, while
two women were stripped to the waist in the mid-winter
snow and lashed at the cart-tail through eleven
towns), ear-croppings, and tongue-borings, to the
death penalty suffered by three men and one woman.
The intervention of Charles II. referred only to the
death penalty. Whippings continued until 1677, and
imprisonment for tithes until 1724.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a class="footnote" href="#fnote-19" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> It is interesting that Penn did his utmost&mdash;even
to attempting to bribe the secretaries when the
charter was drawn up&mdash;to abolish the <em>Penn</em> prefixed
by James II. to his own original <em>Sylvania</em>.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
